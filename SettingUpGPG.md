# Setting Up 

All commits have both the Author and the Committer when they are submitted. When you install git and set up your user.email and user.name you pop in your email and name. If someone else were to put in your name and email it can make it look as though you have comitted the change.  

 

This is the case because if this was required it wouldn't be possible to project projects on other channels because it would have to carry all the old accounts carrying the previous commits. For example if someone were to delete an account, what would happen to the commit information.  

 

To prove that you are the committer on git we can use GNU Privacy guard which creates 2 keys, a public one and a private one, that are used for the encryption and signing of the data.
